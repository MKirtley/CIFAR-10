# CIFAR-10
Performing a number of experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Experimenting with different architectures, filters, pooling types, normalisation, regularisation, optimisation options. Also experimented with applying data augmentation and transfer learning.

Achieved 85% validation accuracy with my own implemented model and 91% validation accuracy after applying the InceptionResNetV2 pre-trained model.
